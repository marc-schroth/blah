- throw Error objects, not Strings
- === and !==
- Response format
- Internal functions = allowed (though consider making them generic and class-level)
- Public/Private Variables/Functions order
- Define all variables at top of function (alpha or related?)
- RETURN PROMISES (or Observables?)
- USE LODASH
- Make get functions generic, and allow caller to extract specific information they need, unless you have a good reason (ie. admin-specific data, joins needed, etc)
